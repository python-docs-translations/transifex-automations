"Starting with the 3.13 release, CPython has support for a build of Python "
"called :term:`free threading` where the :term:`global interpreter lock` "
"(GIL) is disabled.  Free-threaded execution allows for full utilization of "
"the available processing power by running threads in parallel on available "
"CPU cores. While not all software will benefit from this automatically, "
"programs designed with threading in mind will run faster on multi-core "
"hardware."
