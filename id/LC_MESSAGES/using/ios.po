"Python on iOS is unlike Python on desktop platforms. On a desktop platform, "
"Python is generally installed as a system resource that can be used by any "

"running a Python script."

"On iOS, there is no concept of installing as a system resource. The only "

"As a result, the only way you can use Python on iOS is in embedded mode - "

"standard library, and all your Python code is then packaged as a standalone "
"bundle that can be distributed via the iOS App Store."

"This conflicts with the usual Python approach for distributing binaries, "
