"This module implements the HMAC algorithm as described by :rfc:`2104`. The "
"interface allows to use any hash function with a *fixed* digest size. In "
"particular, extendable output functions such as SHAKE-128 or SHAKE-256 "
"cannot be used with HMAC."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/hmac.rst:22

"Return a new hmac object.  *key* is a bytes or bytearray object giving the "
"secret key.  If *msg* is present, the method call ``update(msg)`` is made. "
"*digestmod* is the digest name, digest constructor or module for the HMAC "
"object to use.  It may be any name suitable to :func:`hashlib.new`. Despite "
"its argument position, it is required."

"Parameter *key* can be a bytes or bytearray object. Parameter *msg* can be "

"Return digest of *msg* for given secret *key* and *digest*. The function is "
"equivalent to ``HMAC(key, msg, digest).digest()``, but uses an optimized C "
"or inline implementation, which is faster for messages that fit into memory. "

"`~hmac.new`."
