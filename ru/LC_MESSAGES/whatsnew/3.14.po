"A new type of interpreter has been added to CPython. It uses tail calls "
"between small C functions that implement individual Python opcodes, rather "
"than one large C case statement. For certain newer compilers, this "
"interpreter provides significantly better performance. Preliminary numbers "
"on our machines suggest anywhere up to 30% faster Python code, and a "
"geometric mean of 3-5% faster on ``pyperformance`` depending on platform and "
"architecture. The baseline is Python 3.14 built with Clang 19 without this "
"new interpreter."
