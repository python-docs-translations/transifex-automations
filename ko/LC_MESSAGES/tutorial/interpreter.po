"The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with "

"A second way of starting the interpreter is ``python -c command [arg] ...``, "

"*command* in its entirety."

"When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments "

"no arguments are given, ``sys.argv[0]`` is an empty string.  When the script "
"name is given as ``'-'`` (meaning  standard input), ``sys.argv[0]`` is set "
"to ``'-'``.  When :option:`-c` *command* is used, ``sys.argv[0]`` is set to "
"``'-c'``.  When :option:`-m` *module* is used, ``sys.argv[0]``  is set to "
"the full name of the located module.  Options found after  :option:`-c` "
"*command* or :option:`-m` *module* are not consumed  by the Python "
"interpreter's option processing but left in ``sys.argv`` for  the command or "
