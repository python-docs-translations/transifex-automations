"This module provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without "
"having to sort the list after each insertion.  For long lists of items with "
"expensive comparison operations, this can be an improvement over the more "
"common approach.  The module is called :mod:`bisect` because it uses a basic "
"bisection algorithm to do its work.  The source code may be most useful as a "
"working example of the algorithm (the boundary conditions are already "
"right!)."
