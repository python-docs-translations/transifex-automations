"Python's C API is covered by the Backwards Compatibility Policy, :pep:`387`. "
"While the C API will change with every minor release (e.g. from 3.9 to "
"3.10), most changes will be source-compatible, typically by only adding new "
"API. Changing existing API or removing API is only done after a deprecation "
"period or to fix serious issues."

"Python 的 C 语言 API 包含于向下兼容政策 :pep:`387` 中。C API 会跟随小版本的发"
"布而发生变化（比如 3.9 到 3.10 的时候），不过大多数变化都是源代码级兼容的，通"
"常只会增加新的 API。已有 API 的修改或删除，只有在废止期过后或修复严重问题时才"
"会进行。"

"CPython's Application Binary Interface (ABI) is forward- and backwards-"

"Python 3.2 introduced the *Limited API*, a subset of Python's C API. "

"The Stable ABI contains symbols exposed in the :ref:`Limited API <limited-c-"

msgid ""
"On Windows, extensions that use the Stable ABI should be linked against "
"``python3.dll`` rather than a version-specific library such as ``python39."

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:77
msgid ""
"On some platforms, Python will look for and load shared library files named "
"with the ``abi3`` tag (e.g. ``mymodule.abi3.so``). It does not check if such "
"extensions conform to a Stable ABI. The user (or their packaging tools) need "
"to ensure that, for example, extensions built with the 3.10+ Limited API are "
"not installed for lower versions of Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:84
msgid ""
"All functions in the Stable ABI are present as functions in Python's shared "

"The goal for the Limited API is to allow everything that is possible with "
"the full C API, but possibly with a performance penalty."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:95
msgid ""
"For example, while :c:func:`PyList_GetItem` is available, its “unsafe” macro "
"variant :c:func:`PyList_GET_ITEM` is not. The macro can be faster because it "
"can rely on version-specific implementation details of the list object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:100
msgid ""
"Without ``Py_LIMITED_API`` defined, some C API functions are inlined or "
"replaced by macros. Defining ``Py_LIMITED_API`` disables this inlining, "
"allowing stability as Python's data structures are improved, but possibly "
"reducing performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:105
msgid ""
"By leaving out the ``Py_LIMITED_API`` definition, it is possible to compile "
"a Limited API extension with a version-specific ABI. This can improve "
"performance for that Python version, but will limit compatibility. Compiling "
"with ``Py_LIMITED_API`` will then yield an extension that can be distributed "
"where a version-specific one is not available – for example, for prereleases "
"of an upcoming Python version."

msgid ""
"Note that compiling with ``Py_LIMITED_API`` is *not* a complete guarantee "
"that code conforms to the :ref:`Limited API <limited-c-api>` or the :ref:"
"`Stable ABI <stable-abi>`. ``Py_LIMITED_API`` only covers definitions, but "
"an API also includes other issues, such as expected semantics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:121
msgid ""
"One issue that ``Py_LIMITED_API`` does not guard against is calling a "
"function with arguments that are invalid in a lower Python version. For "
"example, consider a function that starts accepting ``NULL`` for an argument. "
"In Python 3.9, ``NULL`` now selects a default behavior, but in Python 3.8, "
"the argument will be used directly, causing a ``NULL`` dereference and "
"crash. A similar argument works for fields of structs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:128
msgid ""
"Another issue is that some struct fields are currently not hidden when "
"``Py_LIMITED_API`` is defined, even though they're part of the Limited API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:131
msgid ""
"For these reasons, we recommend testing an extension with *all* minor Python "
"versions it supports, and preferably to build with the *lowest* such version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:134
msgid ""
"We also recommend reviewing documentation of all used API to check if it is "
"explicitly part of the Limited API. Even with ``Py_LIMITED_API`` defined, a "
"few private declarations are exposed for technical reasons (or even "
"unintentionally, as bugs)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:139
msgid ""
"Also note that the Limited API is not necessarily stable: compiling with "
"``Py_LIMITED_API`` with Python 3.8 means that the extension will run with "
"Python 3.12, but it will not necessarily *compile* with Python 3.12. In "
"particular, parts of the Limited API may be deprecated and removed, provided "
"that the Stable ABI stays stable."

msgid "Platform Considerations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:151
msgid ""
"ABI stability depends not only on Python, but also on the compiler used, "
"lower-level libraries and compiler options. For the purposes of the :ref:"
"`Stable ABI <stable-abi>`, these details define a “platform”. They usually "
"depend on the OS type and processor architecture"
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/stable.rst:156
msgid ""
"It is the responsibility of each particular distributor of Python to ensure "
"that all Python versions on a particular platform are built in a way that "
"does not break the Stable ABI. This is the case with Windows and macOS "
