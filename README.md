Subtitle translations of Python: The Documentary
================================================

This branch stores the translated subtitles for the documentary:
**Python: The Documentary | An origin story**.

Translation is done on [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/python-doc/the-documentary-subtitle/),
but PR contributions are also welcome.

The video is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfH4QL4VqJ0).

The source subtitle file is named `subtitle.rst`,
and translations are named `subtitle-<lang>.rst`
(replacing `<lang>` with the language code).
